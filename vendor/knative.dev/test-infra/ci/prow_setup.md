# Prow setup

## Creating the cluster

1. Create the GKE cluster, the role bindings and the GitHub secrets. You might
   need to update [Makefile](./prow/Makefile). For details, see
   <https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/getting_started_deploy.md>.

   **Note**: It's not advisable to turn on auto-scaling for the Prow cluster, as
   it can cause temporary DNS errors when test jobs are scheduled to nodes that
   are not fully initialized yet; for details see
   https://github.com/knative/test-infra/issues/1082.

1. Ensure the GCP projects listed in
   [resources.yaml](./prow/boskos/resources.yaml) are created.

1. Apply [config_start.yaml](./prow/config_start.yaml) to the cluster.

1. Apply Boskos [config_start.yaml](./prow/boskos/config_start.yaml) to the
   cluster.

1. Run `make update-all-cluster-deployments`, `make update-boskos-resource`,
   `make update-config`, `make update-plugins` and
   `make update-all-boskos-deployments`.

1. If SSL needs to be reconfigured, promote your ingress IP to static in Cloud
   Console, and
   [create the TLS secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls).

## Adding new Kubernetes resources

1. If it's Boskos related, check under
   [prow/boskos/deployments](./prow/boskos/deployments) and add a new file there
   if not exist.

1. If not Boskos related, check under [prow/deployments](./prow/deployments) and
   add a new file there if not exist.

1. If the change involves adding new namespace, add it in
   [prow/config_start.yaml](./prow/config_start.yaml).

1. Create a PR with the changes and once it's merged ask one of the owners of
   _knative/test-infra_ to deploy the new resource by running
   `make get-cluster-credentials`, `kubectl apply -f ./config_start.yaml`,
   `make update-single-boskos-deployment [FILE_NAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION]` (if
   Boskos related), or
   `make update-single-deployment [FILE_NAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION]` (if not Boskos
   related).

## Expanding Boskos pool

1. All projects and permissions can be created by running
   `./ci/prow/boskos/create_projects.sh`. For example, to create 10 projects
   named `knative-boskos-51`, `knative-boskos-52`, ... `knative-boskos-60`, run:
   `./ci/prow/boskos/create_projects 51 10 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X /tmp/successful.out`.
   You will need to substitute the actual billing ID for the third argument. In
   the event the script fails, it should be easy to follow along with in the GUI
   or run on the CLI. The gcloud billing command is still in alpha/beta, so it's
   probably the section most likely to give you trouble.

1. Increase the compute CPU quota for the project to 200. Go to
   <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?service=compute.googleapis.com&metric=CPUs&project=PROJECT_NAME>
   (replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the real project name) and click `Edit Quota`.
   Select at least five regions to increase the quota
   (`us-central1, us-west1, us-east1, europe-west1, asia-east1`). This needs to
   be done manually and should get automatically approved once the request is
   submitted. For the reason, enter _Need more resources for running tests_.

1. Edit [resources.yaml](./prow/boskos/resources.yaml) with the new projects.
   Conveniently ready for cut-and-paste from the output file in the previous
   step.

1. Get the commit reviewed.

1. Run `make update-boskos-resource` to update the Boskos resource.

## Setting up Prow for a new organization

1. In GitHub, add the following
   [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) to the org (or repo), in
   `application/json` format and for all events. Ask one of the owners of
   knative/test-infra for the webhook secrets.

   1. <http://prow.knative.dev/hook> (for Prow)
   1. <https://github-dot-knative-tests.appspot.com/webhook> (for Gubernator PR
      Dashboard)

1. Create a team called _Knative Prow Robots_, and make it an Admin of the org
   (or repo).

1. Invite at least [knative-prow-robot](https://github.com/knative-prow-robot)
   for your org. Add it to the robots team you created. For automated releases
   and metrics reporting (e.g., code coverage) you'll need to also add
   [knative-prow-releaser-robot](https://github.com/knative-prow-releaser-robot)
   and [knative-metrics-robot](https://github.com/knative-metrics-robot).

1. Add the org (and/or repo) to the [plugins.yaml](./prow/plugins.yaml) file, at
   least to the `approve` and `plugins` sections. Create a PR with the changes
   and once it's merged ask one of the owners of _knative/test-infra_ to deploy
   the new config.

## Setting up Prow for a new repo (reviewers assignment and auto merge)

1. Create the appropriate `OWNERS` files (at least one for the root dir).

1. Make sure that _Knative Robots_ is an Admin of the repo.

1. Add the repo to the
   [tide section](https://github.com/knative/test-infra/blob/b2cd02e6836ea2744ad838522b9eaf46385990f7/ci/prow/templates/prow_config_header.yaml#L72)
   in the [Prow config template](./prow/templates/prow_config_header.yaml) and
   run `make config`. Create a PR with the changes to the template and generated
   [config.yaml](./prow/config.yaml) file. Once the PR is merged, ask one of the
   owners of _knative/test-infra_ to deploy the new config.

1. Wait a few minutes, check that Prow is working by entering `/woof` as a
   comment in any PR in the new repo.

1. Set **tide** as a required status check for the master branch.

### Setting up jobs for a new repo

1. Have the test infrastructure in place (usually this means having at least
   `//test/presubmit-tests.sh` working, and optionally `//hack/release.sh`
   working for automated nightly releases).

1. Merge a pull request that:

   1. Updates [config_knative.yaml](./prow/config_knative.yaml), the Prow config
      file (usually, copy and update the existing configuration from another
      repository). Run `make config` to regenerate
      [config.yaml](./prow/config.yaml), otherwise the presubmit test will fail.

   1. Updates the Testgrid config with the new buckets, tabs and dashboard.

1. Ask one of the owners of _knative/test-infra_ to:

   1. Run `make update-config` in `ci/prow`.

   1. Run `make update-config` in `ci/testgrid`.

1. Wait a few minutes, enter `/retest` as a comment in any PR in the repo and
   ensure the test jobs are executed.

1. Set the new test jobs as required status checks for the master branch.
