# Contributing

Non trivial changes should be discussed with the project maintainers by
opening a [Feature Request](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/issues/new?template=feature_request.md),
clearly explaining rationale, background and possible implementation ideas.
Feel free to use to provide code in such discussions.

## Implementation

Work should happen in an open pull request with a WIP label
which gives visibility to the development process and provides
continuous integration feedback.

The pull request description must be well written and provide the necessary
context and background for review. If there's a proposal issue, it must be
referenced. When ready, remove the WIP label assign the PR a reviewer who will
review your PR.
