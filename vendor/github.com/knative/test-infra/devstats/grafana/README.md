# Grafana

[Grafana](<[http://github.com/grafana/grafana](http://github.com/grafana/grafana)>)
is the front end display for the dashboards generated by devstats. Dashboards
are
[automatically imported](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource-config-file)
when the application starts up through the configuration defined in the
[provisioning](./provisioning/) folder.

Grafana dashboards are stored in the [dashboards/knative](./dashboards/knative)
directory. Any dashboards added, changed, or removed from the directory in
GitHub will be detected automatically by a batch job and subsequently reflected
in the Grafana UI.

By Default, devstats populates a Postgres database with GitHub metrics. This is
configured in
[the provisioning directory](./provisioning/datasources/datasource.yaml), and
additional datasources can be configured there, as well. See the
[Official Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource)
for information on configuring multiple datasources.

Each dashboard is a json file containing a `datasource` field. Any dashboard
using a new datasource should have this configuration.
